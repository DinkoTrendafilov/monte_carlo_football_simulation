# Football Season Probability Analyzer

A sophisticated probabilistic model that combines Multinomial distribution analysis with Monte Carlo simulations to predict football season outcomes.

## üéØ Features

- **Multinomial Probability Analysis**: Exact mathematical probabilities for all possible season combinations
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Practical season outcome distributions through extensive simulations  
- **Comparative Analysis**: Side-by-side comparison of analytical vs simulation results
- **League Position Probabilities**: Championship, European qualification, and relegation chances
- **Visual Distribution**: Point distribution analysis with graphical representations

## üßÆ Mathematical Foundation

### Multinomial Distribution
The model uses the multinomial distribution formula:

P(W, D, L) = n! / (W! √ó D! √ó L!) √ó p_win^W √ó p_draw^D √ó p_loss^L
text


Where:
- **W**: Number of wins
- **D**: Number of draws  
- **L**: Number of losses
- **n**: Total matches (typically 38 for top leagues)
- **p_win**, **p_draw**, **p_loss**: Probabilities for each outcome

### Monte Carlo Integration
For complex probability spaces, we use Monte Carlo methods:
- Simulates thousands of complete seasons
- Provides empirical probability distributions
- Validates analytical results

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib

Basic Usage
